        <p class="content">This graph shows the change of unusually hot temperatures across
          the U.S. from year 1948 to 2015.<br />
          <br />
          The cricles represent the wather stations across the country. The circles 
          are scaled by the change of unusually hot days at each station. Orange cricles 
          indicate the unusual hot days are increasing overtime(more common), blue 
          circles indicate the number of unusual hot days are decreasing(less common), 
          the transparent circles indicate the change is zero.<br />
          <br />
          The changes are also grouped by range of 10, individual groups can be viewed 
          using the selection bar above.<br />
